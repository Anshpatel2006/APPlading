- Sticky, responsive navigation bar with links to all sections (always visible at the top)
- Jumbotron welcome section
- Features section with images
- About, Testimonials, FAQ, and Contact sections
- Contact form with validation
- Footer with labeled contact details

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the following files are present in the same directory:
   - `index.html` (HTML structure)
   - `style.css` (Custom styles)
   - `script.js` (Custom JavaScript for interactivity and validation)
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

No build steps or dependencies are required—everything runs in the browser using CDN links for Bootstrap.
